In this assignment, I have learned how to work on Google Colaboratory and Github repositories. I have got a brief idea about how these platforms useful for analyzing the data, and how to perform multiple operations on data, how to connect to Google Drive, how to save the code to the Github repository.

I have performed multiple operations on the data like

a) Printing the first 75 characters in the text. 
b) Sorting the characters in the file and find out the unique characters count in that. 
c) Split the words based on our choice in the file and printing the length. 
d) Converting the characters to upper case, lower case.

I had faced an issue with creating two subfolders in Github (Source, Documents). After the one to one discussion on Tuesday's class, I have got a solution and created two folders.

I have attached all the screenshots that show the code snippets and output.
