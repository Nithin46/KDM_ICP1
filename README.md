In this assignment, I have learned how to work on Google colab and Github repositories. And I had got a brief idea about how these platfroms useful for analyzing the data and how to perform operations on the data, how to connect to Google drive, how to save it to the Github repository.

I have performed multiple operations on the data like
a) Printing the first 75 characters in the text.
b) Sorting the characters in the file and find out the unique characters in that.
c) Split the words based on our choice in the file and printing the length.
d) Converting the characters to upper case, lower case.

I have attached all the screenshots that shows the code snippets and output.
